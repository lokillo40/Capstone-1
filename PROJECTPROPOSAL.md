**Project Proposal: Sneakers App**

1. **Tech Stack**: The tech stack for the final project will include Python for the backend using Flask as the web framework, jQuery for frontend interactivity, and Bootstrap for responsive and user-friendly design.

2. **Focus**: The project will be evenly focused on both the frontend UI and the backend to create a full-stack application.

3. **Application Type**: The project will be a website accessible from standard web browsers.

4. **Project Goal**: The goal of the project is to provide sneaker enthusiasts with a seamless platform to access information about sneaker releases, allowing users to register, log in, search for sneakers, and curate their favorites.

5. **User Demographic**: The primary users of the app will be individuals interested in sneaker culture, sneaker enthusiasts, and collectors. The demographic will likely include people of various age groups who share a passion for sneakers.

6. **Data Source**: The project will utilize the "v1 sneakers" API from RapidAPI.com, which provides comprehensive data about sneaker releases, including release dates, images, descriptions, and other relevant details.

7. **Approach**:
   
   	a. **Database Schema**: The database will consist of at least two tables: a "users" table to store user information (username, password, etc.) and a "favorites" table to save user-specific sneaker favorites.

  	 b. **API Challenges**: Potential challenges with the API may include rate limiting, data format changes, and ensuring the accuracy and timeliness of the information.

  	 c. **Data Security**: Sensitive user information such as passwords and usernames will be securely stored using encryption techniques.

 	 d. **Functionality**: The app will allow users to register, log in, search for sneakers by various criteria (e.g., brand, release date), and add sneakers to their favorites list.

  	 e. **User Flow**: Users will start by registering or logging in. Afterward, they can browse and search for sneakers, view detailed information about each release, and add sneakers to their favorites list.

  	 f. **Stretch Goals**: Stretch goals may include implementing additional features such as user reviews, notifications for upcoming releases, and integration with e-commerce platforms for purchasing sneakers directly through the app.
